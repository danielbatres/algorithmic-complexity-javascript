## Algorithmic Complexity Evaluation with JavaScript

This project focuses on the evaluation of time and space complexity of algorithms using Big O notation, and employs a concise and simplified evaluation approach.

### Evaluation Methods

JavaScript is used to perform the evaluations, making use of the following functions:
- `console.time()`
- `console.timeEnd()`
- `performance.now()`

These functions assist in measuring the execution time of algorithms. It's important to note that the data obtained may not be entirely precise, but they offer a practical way to estimate algorithm performance.
